# Gelato/Sorbet Sentiment Analysis

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset

I completed this project in R Markdown, which typically outputs to HTML. I included both the R Markdown file (.Rmd) and the HTML file (.html) 
in this repository. To view the HTML output in your web browser, open the .html file and click the download button in the top right corner 
(in the same row as "Code" and "Blame", above "View Raw"). Then open the downloaded file. 

I also created an R Markdown output in Word (as an alternative viewing option). I included this file (.docx) in the repository as well. The graphs
are a little smaller in this output than the HTML output, but it's a good alternate option. To view my project in Word, click on the .docx file and then
hit "View Raw."
